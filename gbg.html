         <p>Part of my bachelor thesis was to create UI/UX that would make possible & confortable to share personal information within IT workgroups.</p> 
<p>We are talking about informations that are acquired by mobile phone sensors, for example GPS and location sharing without breaking users privacy.</p>

              <p>To solve the privacy issue I did a lot of research, interviews and group discussions. That resulted in theoretical background for application. And so I could start designing User interface for further testing.

          <div class="desc-text border-top">
              <p>The UI proposal was tested by a big group of people and the interface was changed and upgraded based on their feedback. Working prototype was created based in this design.
